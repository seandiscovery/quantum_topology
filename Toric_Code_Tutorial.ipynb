    "The function ``construct_toric_code`` returns ``NetworkX`` graph structures. For details, see the ``NetworkX`` documentation, but note that we can access the edges and nodes of the primal and dual graphs as necessary. Each edge contains a ``QubitPlaceholder`` object representing a data qubit, while each vertex contains a ``QubitPlaceholder`` object representing the $X$ stabilizers (on the primal graph) or $Z$ stabilizers (on the dual graph). \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in our protocl is to initialize the qubits to $+1$ eigenstates of the $X$ stabilizers and $Z$ stabilizers. Unfortunately, this has proven to be the major limiting factor in our experiment, as constructing this initial state is highly non-trivial. We've attempted to follow the method described in Dennis et al. (http://info.phys.unm.edu/~alandahl/papers/jmp43_4452.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3XnFXFsdVkoUs9iCp0oA-ssHtflBFpPubNwNZxQ_BNvmjcCldh0xhd7mg), which involves the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initialize the qubits to the state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Without applying any errors, run the $X$ syndrome extraction protocol, which involves the circuit shown in Figure 1 of our final paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) After the $X$ syndrome extraction, about half of our ancilla qubits are expected to be in the $|1\\rangle$ state, which corresponds to a measured error (that is, a $-1$ eigenvalue upon measuring the $X$ stabilizer). Construct an arbitrary one-chain with these error nodes on the boundaries (in this case, a \"one-chain\" is simply a collection of edges between vertices in the graph; note that these edges do not have to form one continuous path). Then apply a $Z$ operator to the data qubit on each edge of this one-chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this procedure, the data qubits of the toric code are in a $+1$ eigenstate of the stabilizer operators. We started an implementation of this initialization procedure in the function ``initialize_toric_code`` below. Unfortunately, we haven't yet figured out a good algorithm for generating a one-chain that has error nodes as a boundary. We're currently working on this problem, but it's been a lot more difficult than we were expecting! "
